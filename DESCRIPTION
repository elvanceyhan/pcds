Title: Proximity Catch Digraphs and Their Applications
Version: 0.1.6
Author: Elvan Ceyhan
Maintainer: Elvan Ceyhan <elvanceyhan@gmail.com>
Description: Contains the functions for construction and visualization of 
    various families of the proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) (see (Ceyhan (2005) ISBN:978-3-639-19063-2),
    for computing the graph invariants for testing the patterns of segregation and association against complete spatial randomness (CSR))
    or Uniformness in one, two and three dimensional cases.
    The package also has tools for generating points from these spatial patterns.
    The graph invariants used in testing spatial point data are the domination number (Ceyhan (2011)
    <doi:10.1080/03610921003597211>) and arc density (Ceyhan et al. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2005.03.002>;
    Ceyhan et al. (2007) <doi:10.1002/cjs.5550350106>). The PCD families considered are Arc-Slice PCDs,
    Proportional-Edge PCDs and Central Similarity PCDs.
