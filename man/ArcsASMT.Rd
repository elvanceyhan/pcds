\title{An object of class "PCDs":

The arcs of Arc Slice Proximity Catch Digraph (AS-PCD) for a 2D data set - multiple triangle case}
\usage{
ArcsASMT(Xp, Yp, M = "CC")
}
\arguments{
\item{Xp}{A set of 2D points which constitute the vertices of the AS-PCD}

\item{Yp}{A set of 2D points which constitute the vertices of the Delaunay triangulation. The Delaunay
triangles partition the convex hull of \code{Yp} points.}

\item{M}{The circumcenter "CC" of each Delaunay triangle \code{tri} or 3D point in barycentric
coordinates which serves as a center in the interior of each Delaunay triangle;
default is \code{M}="CC" i.e. the circumcenter of each triangle}
}
\value{
A list with the elements
\item{type}{A description of the type of the digraph}
\item{parameters}{Parameters of the digraph, here, it is the center used to construct the vertex regions, i.e.
circumcenter.}
\item{tess.points}{Points on which the tessellation of the study region is performed, here, tessellation
is the Delaunay triangulation based on \code{Yp} points.}
\item{tess.name}{Name of data set used in tessellation, i.e., \code{Yp}}
\item{vertices}{Vertices of the digraph, \code{Xp}.}
\item{vert.name}{Name of the data set which constitute the vertices of the digraph}
\item{S}{tails (or sources) of the arcs of AS-PCD for 2D data set \code{Xp} in the multiple triangle case
as the vertices of the digraph}
\item{E}{heads (or arrow ends) of the arcs of AS-PCD for 2D data set \code{Xp} in the multiple triangle case
as the vertices of the digraph}
\item{mtitle}{Text for "main" title in the plot of the digraph}
\item{quant}{Various quantities for the digraph: number of vertices, number of partition points,
number of intervals, number of arcs, and arc density.}
}
\description{
Returns arcs as tails (or sources) and heads (or arrow ends) of AS-PCD whose vertices are the data set \code{Xp}.

AS proximity regions are defined with respect to the Delaunay triangles based on
\code{Yp} points, i.e., AS proximity regions are defined only for \code{Xp} points inside the convex hull of \code{Yp} points.
That is, arcs may exist for points only inside the convex hull of \code{Yp} points.
It also provides various descriptions and quantities about the arcs of the AS-PCD
such as number of arcs, arc density, etc.

Vertex regions are based on the center \code{M}="CC"
for circumcenter of each Delaunay triangle or \eqn{M=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)} in barycentric coordinates in the
interior of each Delaunay triangle; default is \code{M}="CC" i.e. circumcenter of each triangle.
