\description{
This is an "htest" (i.e., hypothesis test) function which performs a hypothesis test of complete spatial
randomness (CSR) or uniformity of \code{Xp} points in the convex hull of \code{Yp} points against the alternatives
of segregation (where \code{Xp} points cluster away from \code{Yp} points i.e. cluster around the centers of the Delaunay
triangles) and association (where \code{Xp} points cluster around \code{Yp} points) based on the normal approximation
to the binomial distribution of the domination number of PE-PCD for uniform 2D data
in the convex hull of \code{Yp} points

The function yields the test statistic, \eqn{p}-value for the corresponding alternative,
the confidence interval, estimate and null value for the parameter of interest (which is Pr(Domination
Number=3)), and method and name of the data set used.

Under the null hypothesis of uniformity of \code{Xp} points in the convex hull of \code{Yp} points, probability of success
(i.e. Pr(Domination Number=3) ) equals to its expected value under the uniform distribution) and
\code{alternative} could be two-sided, or left-sided (i.e. data is accumulated around the \code{Yp} points, or association)
or right-sided (i.e. data is accumulated around the centers of the triangles, or segregation).

PE proximity region is constructed with the expansion parameter \eqn{r \ge 1} and M-vertex regions where M
is a center that yields non-degenerate asymptotic distribution of the domination number.

The test statistic is based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, when domination number
is scaled to have value  0 and 1 in the one triangle case (i.e., Domination Number - 1 for the one triangle
case). That is, the test statistic is based on the domination number for \code{Xp} points inside convex hull of \code{Yp}
points for the PE-PCD and default convex hull correction, \code{ch.cor}, is \code{FALSE}
where \code{M} is the center that yields nondegenerate asymptotic distribution for the domination number.

For this approximation to work, \code{Yp} must be at least 10 (actually about 15 or more Delaunay triangles)
and \code{Xp} must be at least 10 times more than \code{Yp} points.
