\description{
This is an "htest" (i.e., hypothesis test) function which performs a hypothesis test of complete spatial
randomness (CSR) or uniformity of \code{Xp} points in the convex hull of \code{Yp} points against the alternatives
of segregation (where \code{Xp} points cluster away from \code{Yp} points) and association (where \code{Xp} points cluster around
\code{Yp} points) based on the normal approximation of the arc density of the PE-PCD for uniform 2D data
in the convex hull of \code{Yp} points and yields the test statistic, \eqn{p}-value for the corresponding alternative,
the confidence interval, estimate and null value for the parameter of interest (which is the arc density),
and method and name of the data set used.

Under the null hypothesis of uniformity of \code{Xp} points in the convex hull of \code{Yp} points, arc density
of PE-PCD whose vertices are \code{Xp} points equals to its expected value under the uniform distribution and
\code{alternative} could be two-sided, or left-sided (i.e. data is accumulated around the \code{Yp} points, or association)
or right-sided (i.e. data is accumulated around the centers of the triangles, or segregation).

PE proximity region is constructed with the expansion parameter \eqn{r \ge 1} and CM-vertex regions
(i.e., the test is not available for a general center M at this version of the function).
This test is more appropriate when supports of \code{Xp} and \code{Yp} has a substantial overlap,

\code{ch.cor} is for convex hull correction (default is "no convex hull correction", i.e., \code{ch.cor}=FALSE)
which is recommended when both \code{Xp} and \code{Yp} have the same rectangular support.

density of PE-PCDs.
