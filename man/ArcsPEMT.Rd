\description{
Returns arcs as tails (or sources) and heads (or arrow ends) of Proportional Edge Proximity Catch Digraph
(PE-PCD) whose vertices are the data points in \code{Xp} in the multiple triangle case.

PE proximity regions are
defined with respect to the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points with expansion parameter \eqn{r \ge 1} and
vertex regions in each triangle are based on the center \eqn{M=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)} in barycentric coordinates
in the interior of each Delaunay triangle or based on circumcenter of each Delaunay triangle
(default for \eqn{M=(1,1,1)} which is the center of mass of the triangle).
Each Delaunay triangle is first converted to an (unscaled) basic triangle so that \code{M} will be the same
type of center for each Delaunay triangle (this conversion is not necessary when \code{M} is CM).

Convex hull of \code{Yp} is partitioned by the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points
(i.e., multiple triangles are the set of these Delaunay triangles whose union constitutes the
convex hull of \code{Yp} points). For the number of arcs, loops are not allowed so arcs are only possible
for points inside the convex hull of \code{Yp} points.
