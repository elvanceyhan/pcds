\title{Incidence matrix for Arc Slice Proximity Catch Digraphs (AS-PCDs) - multiple triangle case}
\usage{
IncMatASMT(Xp, Yp, M = "CC")
}
\arguments{
\item{Xp}{A set of 2D points which constitute the vertices of the AS-PCD}

\item{Yp}{A set of 2D points which constitute the vertices of the Delaunay triangles}

\item{M}{"CC" which stands for circumcenter of each Delaunay triangle \code{tri} or 3D point in barycentric
coordinates which serves as a center in the interior of each Delaunay triangle;
default is \code{M}="CC" i.e. the circumcenter of each triangle}
}
\value{
Incidence matrix for the AS-PCD whose vertices are the 2D data set, \code{Xp},
and AS proximity regions are defined in the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points.
}
\description{
Returns the incidence matrix for the AS-PCD whose vertices are a given 2D numerical data set, \code{Xp},
in the convex hull of \code{Yp} which is partitioned by the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points.

AS proximity regions are defined with respect to the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points and vertex
regions are based on the center \code{M}="CC"
for circumcenter of each Delaunay triangle or \eqn{M=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)} in barycentric coordinates in the
interior of each Delaunay triangle; default is \code{M}="CC" i.e. circumcenter of each triangle.
Loops are allowed, so the diagonal entries are all equal to 1.
