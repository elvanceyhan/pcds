\title{Incidence matrix for Proportional Edge Proximity Catch Digraphs (PE-PCDs) - multiple triangle case}
\usage{
IncMatPEMT(Xp, Yp, r, M = c(1, 1, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{Xp}{A set of 2D points which constitute the vertices of the PE-PCD}

\item{Yp}{A set of 2D points which constitute the vertices of the Delaunay triangles}

\item{r}{A positive real number which serves as the expansion parameter in PE proximity region; must be \eqn{\ge 1}}

\item{M}{A 3D point in barycentric coordinates which serves as a center in the interior of each Delaunay
triangle or circumcenter of each Delaunay triangle (for this argument should be set as \code{M}="CC"),
default for \eqn{M=(1,1,1)} which is the center of mass of each triangle}
}
\value{
Incidence matrix for the PE-PCD with vertices being 2D data set, \code{Xp}.
PE proximity regions are constructed with respect to the Delaunay triangles and \code{M}-vertex regions.
}
\description{
Returns the incidence matrix of Proportional Edge Proximity Catch Digraph
(PE-PCD) whose vertices are the data points in \code{Xp} in the multiple triangle case.

PE proximity regions are
defined with respect to the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points with expansion parameter \eqn{r \ge 1} and
vertex regions in each triangle are based on the center \eqn{M=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)} in barycentric coordinates
in the interior of each Delaunay triangle or based on circumcenter of each Delaunay triangle
(default for \eqn{M=(1,1,1)} which is the center of mass of the triangle).

Each Delaunay triangle is first converted to an (unscaled) basic triangle so that \code{M} will be the same
type of center for each Delaunay triangle (this conversion is not necessary when \code{M} is CM).

Convex hull of \code{Yp} is partitioned by the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points
(i.e., multiple triangles are the set of these Delaunay triangles whose union constitutes the
convex hull of \code{Yp} points). For the incidence matrix loops are allowed,
so the diagonal entries are all equal to 1.
