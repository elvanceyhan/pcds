\title{(Parameterized) Centers of intervals}
\usage{
centersMc(x, c)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector real numbers that constitute the end points of intervals}

\item{c}{A positive real number in \eqn{(0,1)} parameterizing the centers inside the intervals.
For the interval, \eqn{int=(a,b)}, the parameterized center is \eqn{M_c=a+c(b-a)}}
}
\value{
(parameterized) centers of the intervals based on \code{x} points as a vector
}
\description{
Returns the centers of the intervals based on 1D points in x parameterized by \code{c} in \eqn{(0,1)}
so that \eqn{100c} \% of the length of interval is to the left of \eqn{M_c} and \eqn{100(1-c)} \% of the length of the interval
is to the right of \eqn{M_c}. That is, for an interval \eqn{(a,b)}, the parameterized center is \eqn{M_c=a+c(b-a)}
\code{x} is a vector of 1D points, not necessarily sorted.
