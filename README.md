# pcds
This is an R package that contains the functions for computing the arc density and domination number of proximity catch digraphs (PCDs),
and for visualization of PCDs for one, two and three dimensional data. It also contaings functions for generating patterns of segregation, association, complete spatial randomness (CSR) and Uniform data in one, two and three dimensional cases, for testing these patterns based on domination number and arc density of the PCDs. The PCD families considered are Arc-Slice PCDs, Proportional-Edge PCDs and Central Similarity PCDs.
