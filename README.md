<<<<<<< HEAD
This is an R package that contains the functions for generating patterns of segregation, association, complete spatial randomness (CSR) and Uniform data in one, two and three dimensional cases, for testing these patterns based on domination number and arc density of the proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) for two-dimensional data, for visualization of PCDs for one, two and three dimensional data. The PCD families considered are Arc-Slice (AS) PCDs, Proportional-Edge (PE) PCDs and Central Similarity (CS) PCDs.
